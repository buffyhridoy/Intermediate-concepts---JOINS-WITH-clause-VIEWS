SELECT * FROM employee;
SELECT * FROM projects;
SELECT * FROM department;
SELECT * FROM manager;


-- INNER JOIN
-- Fetch the employee name and the department name they belong to.
 -- Whenever we are trying to join two tables we can not just specify the two table that I need to JOIN. Most important thing is we need to specify the condition on which we need to join these two table. We need to join two table base on some column. Find the common column that are present in both that column. It does not matter if the column names are same or not, the value has to be similar.

SELECT e.emp_name, d.department_name
FROM employee e
JOIN department d ON e.dept_id = d.department_id;
